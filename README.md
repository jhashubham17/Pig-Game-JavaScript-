# Pig Game (JavaScript)

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the Pig Game (also known as Dice Game or Pig Dice) in JavaScript. The game is designed to be played in a web browser and supports two players taking turns to roll a dice and accumulate scores. The first player to reach the target score wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Open `https://pig-game-for-fun.netlify.app` in your web browser.
2. Enter the target score (e.g., 100 points) and click "Set Target Score."
3. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. The result will be displayed.
4. If you roll a 1, your turn ends, and you lose all points accumulated during this turn.
5. If you roll any other number, the points on the dice will be added to your current turn score.
6. You can choose to "Hold" your current score, which will be added to your total score, and it will be the other player's turn.
7. The game continues until one of the players reaches the target score.
